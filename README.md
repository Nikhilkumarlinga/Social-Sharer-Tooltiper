Social-Sharer-Tooltiper
===============

Social Sharer Tooltiper lets you share the exact content on a page which you actually want to share. It enables you to share selected text on your social network rather the default text specified in the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags. By default, it supports Facebook and Twitter but you can add more networks easily. 

I will try to add possible networks sooner
